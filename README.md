# Practical Promises

In this workshop, we'll be covering how to use promises for asynchronous control flow by using them to log out poem stanzas.

Follow the exercises in `exercise-one.js` and `exercise-two.js`. Each exercise includes a description of its objective as well as an example of a solution using vanilla async callbacks. For each exercise, come up with an equivalent solution using promises.

Execute your code with: `node exercise-one` or `node exercise-two` followed by the name(s) of the problems you want to run. For example, `node exercise-one a` will run problem A.

We will be using the bluebird promise library, and you'll likely find [its documentation](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md) helpful. Strictly speaking you do not need any methods besides those of native ES6 promises, but some of the Bluebird methods may result in more elegant code.
